Overview
========

Ultimately, LSST Alert Production (AP) will need to perform all steps of the Level 1
pipeline automatically on each new raw image from the telescope. Details
are in the LSST Data Management Science Pipelines Design  (LDM-151 :cite:`LDM-151`) and 
the LSST Data Products Definition Document (DPDD :cite:`LSE-163`). Briefly
summarized below and in :ref:`Figure 1<fig-nightly-proc>`, the first portion of these steps are:

1. Instrument Signature Removal (ISR), which includes crosstalk and linearity corrections, bad pixel masking, bias subtraction, and flat field division,
2. Point Source Function (PSF) and background characterization, which includes source detection and measurement,
3. Photometric and World Coordinate System (WCS) calibration, and
4. Image Differencing with an appropriate template (which may need constructing) to create Difference Image Analysis (DIA) source catalogs.

   The first portion of the Nightly Processing Pipeline overview, from Figure 1 of 
   :cite:`LDM-151`. This encompasses all of "Single Frame Processing" and part of "Alert Detection."

A number of packages in the LSST Software Stack have been developed to perform
portions of one or more of these four tasks, but they are not yet linked together
in an automated way. This Prototype AP Pipeline is the first step toward the goal
of an automatic Level 1 Pipeline that can process a set of raw images through 
each of these steps and verify that the output is what we expect.

To achieve this, there are two main python modules under development: 
`ap_pipe <https://github.com/lsst-dm/ap_pipe>`_ and `ap_verify <https://github.com/lsst-dm/ap_verify>`_.
The former is described here, and is used by the latter.


.. _Dataset:

Dataset
=======

We use images from the High Cadence Transient Survey (HiTS) :cite:`for16`, a three-year survey 
from 2013--2015 which used the `Dark Energy Camera (DECam) <http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/DECam-What>`_
on the 4 m Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO).
The primary science goal of this survey is to detect and follow up optical transients
that have characteristic timescales from hours to days, with a particular interest in catching early supernovae.
The distribution of the HiTS survey fields in the sky is shown in :ref:`Figure 2<fig-hits>`.

.. figure:: /_static/forster_fig4.png
   :name: fig-hits
   :alt: Distribution of the HiTS survey fields in the sky, color-coded by year
   
   Spatial distribution of the fields observed in the 2013--2015 HiTS campaign (Figure 4 from :cite:`for16`).
   The fields selected for this dataset are three of the pink ones, which indicate they were visited in both 2014 and 2015.
   Specifically, they are the pair of partially-overlapping pink fields near the bottom center of the 2014 and 2015
   field region and the upper-right-most pink field.

We select HiTS fields ``Blind15A_26``, ``Blind15A_40``, and ``Blind15A_42``, which
are repeat observations of the same region of sky as ``Blind14A_04``, ``Blind14A_10``, and ``Blind14A_09``
fields, respectively. Each field has 34--36 individual visits over about a month, and each DECam image 
consists of 62 CCDs (however, two of these are non-functional).
Most of the visits are in the *g*-band, some are in the *r*-band, and a few are in *i*.

All of these data are in the git-lfs repo `ap_verify_hits2015 <https://github.com/lsst/ap_verify_hits2015>`_
in raw format, along with the corresponding DECam Master Calibration files and camera defect files.
The data also exist on the ``lsst-dev`` server at ``/datasets/decam/_internal/raw/hits`` with the
calibration files at ``/dataset/decam/_internal/calib/cpHits`` and the camera defects at
``/dataset/decam/_internal/calib/bpmDes``. The raw images and calibration files were originally obtained 
from the `NOAO Science Archive <http://archive.noao.edu/search/query>`_ by searching for PI FÃ¶rster.


.. _Tutorial:

Tutorial
========

This tutorial walks a user through using ``ap_pipe`` to run four main processing steps 
with the LSST Stack on a portion of the :ref:`Dataset <Dataset>` described above:

1. ``ingestImagesDecam.py``, from the ``obs_decam`` package but drawing heavily on ``pipe_tasks``,
2. ``ingestCalibs.py``, from the ``pipe_tasks`` package,
3. ``processCcd.py``, from the ``pipe_tasks`` package, and
4. ``imageDifference.py``, also from the ``pipe_tasks`` package.

The prerequisites for running ``ap_pipe`` are:

- The LSST Stack with the standard modules
- Additionally, the ``obs_decam`` and ``ap_pipe`` modules
- A clone of the ``ap_verify_hits2015`` dataset

.. prompt:: bash

   setup lsst_apps
   git clone https://github.com/lsst/obs_decam.git
   git clone https://github.com/lsst/ap_pipe.git
   setup -k -r obs_decam
   setup -k -r ap_pipe
   git clone https://github.com/lsst/ap_verify_hits2015.git

Once you are ready, run ``ap_pipe`` from the command line. You must point to the dataset
with the ``-d`` flag, a desired output location on disk with the ``-o`` flag, and provide
a valid visit and ccdnum dataId string with the ``-i`` flag.

.. prompt:: bash
   
   python ap_pipe/bin.src/ap_pipe.py -d ap_verify_hits2015/ -o output_dir -i "visit=410985 ccdnum=25"

.. note::

    At present (`DM-11390 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-11390>`_), the template used for difference imaging is hard-wired to visit=410929 and ccdnum=25.
    This is a single CCD only of one of the ``Blind15A_40`` visits. If you would like to use a different template,
    you must manually set this in the source code
    (``ap_pipe/python/lsst/ap/pipe/ap_pipe.py``, in the function ``runPipelineAlone``).
    This functionality will be improved when we switch from using a visit as a template to using coadds
    by default (see `DM-11422 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-11422>`_).

.. _Results:

Results
=======

The final difference images and DIA Source catalogs for the test dataset are available 
on the ``lsst-dev`` server at ``/project/mrawls/prototype_ap/diffim_15A38_g/deepDiff/v411033/``.
A small thumbnail preview of the difference images is shown in :ref:`Figure 3<fig-diffim>`.

Future work will extend this to more visits, perhaps using the 2014 visits as templates and the 2015
visits as science. This Prototype Pipeline will be used as a core component of the `AP Minimum Viable System <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/~ebellm/AP+Minimum+Viable+System>`_
with a goal of verifying the different components of LSST image processing as we incrementally build toward
a fully functional AP system.

   Difference images for HiTS field ``Blind15A_38`` with visit 410927 as the template
   image and visit 411033 as the science image. CCDs 2 and 61 are nonoperational, and
   a portion of CCD 31 is also not working. The other CCDs all perform as expected.
