.. _Overview:

Overview
========

Ultimately, LSST Alert Production (AP) will need to perform all steps of the Level 1
pipeline automatically on each new raw image from the telescope. Details
are in the LSST Data Management Science Pipelines Design (LDM-151, [swi17]_) and 
the LSST Data Products Definition Document (DPDD, [jur16]_). Briefly
summarized below and in :ref:`Figure 1<fig-nightly-proc>`, the first portion of these steps are:

1. Instrument Signature Removal (ISR), which includes crosstalk and linearity corrections, bad pixel masking, bias subtraction, and flat field division,
2. Point Source Function (PSF) and background characterization, which includes source detection and measurement,
3. Photometric and World Coordinate System (WCS) calibration, and
4. Image Differencing with an appropriate template (which may need constructing) to create Difference Image Analysis (DIA) source catalogs.

   The first portion of the Nightly Processing Pipeline overview, from Figure 1 of 
   LDM-151 [swi17]_. This encompasses all of "Single Frame Processing" and part of "Alert Detection."

A number of packages in the LSST Software Stack have been developed to perform
portions of one or more of these four tasks, but they are not yet linked together
in an automated way. This Prototype AP Pipeline is the first step toward the goal
of an automatic Level 1 Pipeline that can process a set of raw images through 
each of these steps and verify that the output is what we expect.


.. _Dataset:

Dataset
=======

We use images from the High Cadence Transient Survey (HiTS, [for16]_), a three-year survey 
from 2013--2015 which used the `Dark Energy Camera (DECam) <http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/DECam-What>`_
on the 4 m Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO).
The primary science goal of this survey is to detect and follow up optical transients
that have characteristic timescales from hours to days, with a particular interest in catching early supernovae.
The distribution of the HiTS survey fields in the sky is shown in :ref:`Figure 2<fig-hits>`.

.. figure:: /_static/forster_fig4.png
   :name: fig-hits
   :alt: Distribution of the HiTS survey fields in the sky, color-coded by year
   
   Spatial distribution of the fields observed in the 2013--2015 HiTS campaign (Figure 4 from [for16]_).
   The fields selected for this dataset are three of the pink ones, which indicate they were visited in both 2014 and 2015.

We select HiTS fields ``Blind15A_38``, ``Blind15A_39``, and ``Blind15A_40``, which
are repeat observations of the same region of sky as ``Blind14A_07``, ``Blind14A_08``, and ``Blind14A_10``
fields, respectively. They are all centered near an RA of 10:15:00 hr and Declination of --04:00:00 deg.
Each field has 34--36 individual visits over about a month, and each DECam image consists of 62 CCDs.
Most of the visits are in the *g*-band, some are in the *r*-band, and a few are in *z* or *i*.

For the purposes of this prototype pipeline, we consider two *g*-band visits in ``Blind15A_38`` only.
However, the rest of the visits in fields ``15A_38``--``15A_40`` have been ingested (see details in :ref:`Method <Method>`)
and are ready for the next steps of processing if desired.


.. _Method:

Method
======

To begin, we obtained the dataset by downloading raw images and corresponding master calibration files 
from the `NOAO Science Archive <http://archive.noao.edu/search/query>`_. The HiTS survey data 
may be selected by searching for PI FÃ¶rster. Additionally, the latest set of DECam defects (bad
pixel masks) were obtained from the ``lsst-dev`` server at ``/datasets/decam/calib/bpmDes/2014-12-05/``,
and a set of `Pan-STARRS <https://panstarrs.stsci.edu>`_ astrometric reference catalogs were obtained from 
the ``lsst-dev`` server at ``/datasets/refcats/htm/htm_baseline``.

Next, we ran four main processing steps with the LSST Stack on the data:

1. ``ingestImagesDecam.py``, from the ``obs_decam`` package but drawing heavily on ``pipe_tasks``,
2. ``ingestCalibs.py``, from the ``pipe_tasks`` package,
3. ``processCcd.py``, from the ``pipe_tasks`` package, and
4. ``imageDifference.py``, also from the ``pipe_tasks`` package.

To streamline this process, we wrote a python script called ``decam_process.py`` to handle each step.
It is `available on GitHub <https://github.com/lsst-dm/decam_hits/blob/master/decam_process.py>`_.
While it was only used on the :ref:`Dataset <Dataset>` described above, it can
in principle be applied to any set of raw DECam images using the LSST Stack, as shown below.


.. _Tutorial:

Tutorial
--------

The prerequisites for running the Prototype Pipeline on a dataset of images (\*.fits or \*.fits.fz) are:

- The LSST Stack with the standard modules (``setup lsst_apps``), as well as ``obs_decam`` (``setup obs_decam``)
- A directory containing some raw DECam images, available from the `NOAO Science Archive <http://archive.noao.edu/search/query>`_
- A directory containing DECam MasterCal biases and flats corresponding to the raw images, also available from the the `NOAO Science Archive <http://archive.noao.edu/search/query>`_
- A directory containing DECam defect images, one for each CCD, available on the ``lsst-dev`` server at ``/datasets/decam/calib/bpmDes/2014-12-05/``
- A set of astrometric reference catalogs (example below)
- A personal working copy of the `decam_process <https://github.com/lsst-dm/decam_hits/blob/master/decam_process.py>`_ script

To begin, edit the values near the top of the ``decam_process`` script to reflect your desired directory names
for where processed images will live, as well as to specify the visits and CCDs you wish to process. The default presets are

.. code-block:: python

   repo = 'ingested_15A38/'  # used by ingest, ingestCalibs, processCcd
   calibrepo = 'calibingested_15A38/'  # used by ingestCalibs, processCcd
   processedrepo = 'processed_15A38/'  # used by processCcd, diffIm
   diffimrepo = 'diffim_15A38_g/'  # used by diffIm
   visits = [410927, 411033]  # used by processCcd, diffIm
   # NOTE: visits assumes the first element is template and the rest are science
   ccdnum = '1..62'  # used by processCcd, diffIm
   # NOTE: the default '1..62' value includes all of the DECam CCDs

In general, ``repo`` refers to where ingested images will live, ``calibrepo``
refers to where ingested calibration products (flats and biases) will live, ``processedrepo`` refers to where "calexp"
images will live (i.e., those that have been processed with ``processCcd`` including steps 1 through 3 in :ref:`Overview <Overview>`),
and ``diffimrepo`` refers to where difference images and DIA Sources (catalogs) will ultimately live.
These should each be different directories, and it's recommended to have them all reside in the same top-level directory.
Visit numbers can be found in image headers or retrieved from the registry database created in ``repo`` during image ingestion 
(visit numbers are not used during ingestion, so you may set them after this step). The first visit you specify
in the list will be used as the template.

Finally, copy or link the Pan-STARRS astrometric reference catalog into the directory you've chosen for 
``repo`` and call it ``ref_cats``. If you are working on the ``lsst-dev`` server, you can link the Gaia, 
Pan-STARRS, and SDSS catalogs by 

.. prompt:: bash
   
   mkdir repo
   ln -s /datasets/refcats/htm/htm_baseline repo/ref_cats

Note that the ``repo`` directory is called ``ingested_15A38`` in the default values given above.
If you wish to use an astrometric reference catalog other than Pan-STARRS, you must update the code in the ``doProcessCcd``
function of ``decam_process.py`` accordingly. It is not necessary to explicitly ``mkdir`` the other repositories.

If you really don't want to deal with astrometric reference catalogs, you can skip the astrometry and 
photometric calibration steps by editing the contents of ``args`` in the ``doProcessCcd`` function of ``decam_process.py``. 
In this situation, you would set both ``calibrate.doAstrometry=False`` and ``calibrate.doPhotoCal=False``. 
Be aware that the difference imaging will not work well in this case, however, because the visits 
will not be precisely lined up to the same WCS.

Once you are ready, run the following:

1. Ingest the raw images

.. prompt:: bash
   
   python decam_process.py ingest -f path/to/rawimages/
   
2. Ingest the calibration products (defects and fringes, if present, must be done manually)

.. prompt:: bash

   python decam_process.py ingestCalibs -f path/to/biases/and/flats/
   cd calibrepo
   ingestCalibs.py ../repo --calib . --calibType defect --validity 999 ../path/to/defects/
   cd -

3. Run ``processCcd`` to detect PSF sources, characterize the background, and perform photometric and astrometric calibrations.
The end result of this step is calibrated exposures ("calexp" images). *If you turned off photometric and astrometric calibrations
as described above, this step will still produce calexps, they will just not be precisely aligned from one visit to the next.*

.. prompt:: bash

   python decam_process.py processCcd
   
4. Finally, do difference imaging using the first visit as the template

.. prompt:: bash

   python decam_process.py diffIm

Results
=======

The final difference images and DIA Source catalogs for the test dataset are available 
on the ``lsst-dev`` server at ``/project/mrawls/prototype_ap/diffim_15A38_g/deepDiff/v411033/``.
A small thumbnail preview of the difference images is shown in :ref:`Figure 3<fig-diffim>`.

Future work will extend this to more visits, perhaps using the 2014 visits as templates and the 2015
visits as science. This Prototype Pipeline will be used as a core component of the `AP Minimum Viable System <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/~ebellm/AP+Minimum+Viable+System>`_
with a goal of verifying the different components of LSST image processing as we incrementally build toward
a fully functional AP system.
